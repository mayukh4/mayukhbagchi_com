# mayukhbagchi.com

Hi — I’m Mayukh Bagchi, an Astronomy PhD candidate focused on high‑frequency radio instrumentation, VLBI, and science communication. This site is my home on the internet. I built it to share what I do, where I go, and the projects I care about.

## What this site is

- My writing and notes on astronomy, instrumentation, and curious problems
- My research, projects, and software — including balloon‑borne VLBI work
- My CV, talks, conferences, and travel highlights
- Outreach, public talks, and videos I make
- A simple way to get in touch

## Highlights

- Blogs, rich media posts, and Markdown rendering
- Research and instrumentation pages with visuals
- Conference travel page with photos and context
- CV page (PDF), outreach page, and contact form
- YouTube stats and integrations to surface recent work

## Under the hood (because I enjoy good tooling)

- Next.js (App Router) + React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4
- Supabase + NextAuth for auth and data
- YouTube / Google APIs, with room for indie/Stripe experiments
- Deployed for speed and reliability

## Why I built this

- To showcase my work as an astronomer and instrument builder
- To keep a clean public record of projects, papers, and trips
- To have a place where students, collaborators, and the community can find me
